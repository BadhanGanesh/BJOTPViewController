A very simple and neat-looking view controller that lets you type in OTP's quick and easy.

This is intended to be a drag and drop view controller that gets the work done quickly, in and out, that's it. No fancy customizations, no cluttering the screen with tons of UI elements and crazy colors. You'll be good to go with the default settings.
